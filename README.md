# Inside-Rijndael

The goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of the arithmetic in Rijndael's finite field (underlying the AES blockcipher). We will write a program able to perform the basic operations in Rijndael's finite field, using the extended Euclidean algorithm for computing the multiplicative inverse of a polynomial. Next, we will use that program to re-generate the AES S-Boxes (for both encryption and decryption).
